# How I used AI to ship this fast

> Replace the bullets below with your real notes/screenshots or Loom link.

- Kickstarted scaffold (FastAPI + HTMX) via AI prompt.
- Asked AI to outline `rag.py` API and the retrieval/generation interface.
- Let AI draft Dockerfile and Fly.io config, then I hardened them.
- Generated smoke test and refined it after a first run.
- Iterated prompts to improve UI/UX copy and error handling.

Optional: paste prompt snippets or CLI history here.
